  \section{Introduction}
  The goal of the project was to change the game of the second project, and implement a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to play it.\\
  For this, we first started with making the game restart when the player dies or wins the game, so that we can leave the agent to train
  without having to restart the simulation each time.\\
  We implemented 2 Reinforcement Learning algorithms: Q-Learning and a Neural Network.\\
